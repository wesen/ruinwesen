Hello!

I am very proud to announce the launch of the Ruin & Wesen website at
http://ruinwesen.com/. I am Wesen, and Ruin is my partner in
Canada. We are building analog and digital music gear, and our first
two products are especially direct towards Elektron users. I am
specializing on the digital side and software programming, while Ruin
is a master of analog noise makers. Our goal is to make flexible gear
for musicians, because in electronic music it all boils down more to
the workflow than to the pure sound shaping. Careful thought has been
put into the user interfaces of our machines. Both Ruin and Wesen are
musicians, and value the possibilities that lie in well thought out
instruments.

As each musician's approach to electronic music is different, we believe
in making the instruments easily customizable. This means that we will work
and rework our firmwares, adding additional features, remodelling some,
sometimes completely changing the purpose of our instruments. We also believe
that the users should be able to do these modifications themselves, which is
why we provide extensive documentation, schematics and sourcecode for our
devices.

But without further a due, please welcome the MidiCommand and the
MonoJoystick.

The MidiCommand is a all-around MIDI controller that has native
support for the Elektron MachineDrum. It features 5 endless encoders,
a small backlit LCD and an additional button. In its first firmware,
it features 8 patches, each patch being made of 4 pages of 4 controls
each. Pages and patches can easily be accessed, and each parameter can
be configured using the inbuilt editor. They can also be programmed
from a computer. Furthermore, each page features a Macro knob that
allows you to change up to 4 parameters at once at the twist of a
single knob. Each patch also features a Macro page where each encoder
modifies up to 4 parameters. The MidiCommand can access the effect
machines of the MachineDrum directly, allowing you to tweak effects
without the need of a CTR-FX machine.

The MonoJoystick is a joystick companion for the Elektron MonoMachine.
Its interface makes it very easy to integrate into a normal
MonoMachine setup. It sends the same data as the SFX-6 joystick,
allowing it to be controlled directly using the ASSIGN menu of the
MonoMachine. But more than just a joystick replacement, the
MonoJoystick allows you to send joystick data to multiple tracks at
once. It allows you to revert the current kit to its saved status, and
also allows you to revert a single track to its saved status! If you
had been waiting for CTR-AL on the MonoMachine, the MonoJoystick is
just for you. Press the SELECT button on the MonoJoystick, and each
knob twist on the MonoMachine will be sent to each track. You can also
broadcast knob twist to selected tracks.

Both units can be preordered from our website at http://ruinwesen.com/
. Also check the website for additional information, product manuals,
example videos and DIY information! Use our RSS feeds to stay
up-to-date, there is much more to come in the following weeks.

Cheers, Manuel aka Wesen
